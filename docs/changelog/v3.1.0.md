# Version 3.1.0

## Prefers Reduced Motion support added

- Added props of `inert` and `motion` for rendering according to `(prefers-reduced-motion)` @media query. `inert` will render only when preference is `reduce` whereas `motion` will render only when `no-preference` is given or assumed.
- `inert` and `motion` are also available as slot names when used inside a `<MqResponsive group>` element.
- For SSR support, `defaultMotion` can be passed in the Vue3Mq configuration object with a value of either `reduce` or `no-preference` with the latter being default. 

```html
<MqResponsive tag="span" inert>
    This user prefers reduced motion
</MqResponsive>
```
